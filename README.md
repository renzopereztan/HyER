# HyER

This is a study on hybrid algorithms for experience replay in foundational reinforcement learning.

The folder Algorithms contains the three reinforcement learning algorithms employed in the study. These are the Deep Q-Network, Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient, and the Advantage Actor-Critic.

The folder Logs and Plots contain some of the results. Plots would have the plots generated from the study and Frames show some of the recordings that were made.

The folder Memory contains code for experience replay. It includes the main Python file and a supplementary file implementing a segment tree from OpenAI Baselines.

The repository is largely based on CHAPtER.
